# pf-dash

This project is intended to automate some of the personal finance tasks that I spend time on. Yes, there are plenty of personal finance tools that can be used for a similar purpose. I've tried many of them and I feel that I've just swapped time from one set of tools to another. Maybe the same will happen with pf-dash.
pf-dash will be used to:
1. Track net worth
2. Track income
3. Track expenses
4. Categorize expenses
5. Create a monthly and annual sankey diagram for income and expenses
6. Track mortgage including advanced payments and expected payoff date
7. Track FIRE related expenses stuff (maybe this is a job for just projection lab)
